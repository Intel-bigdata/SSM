<div class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-10">
  <p>
    A rule defines all the things for SSM to work, what kind of data metrics are involved, what
    conditions, at what time which actions should be taken when the conditions are true.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By writing rules,
    a user can easily manage cluster and adjust its behavior for certain purposes. A rule contains 4 parts.  Here
    is the format,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Objects_to_manipulate :  Trigger | Conditions | Commands
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Trigger part is optional.  “:” and “|” are used as the separator to separate different
    rule part. These two characters are reserved for SSM, cannot be used in rule
    content, otherwise rule parse will fail.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Detail information of each rule part are listed in following tables.

    Here is a rule example,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    file:  path matches "/fooA/*.dat": age > 30day | archive
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This example defines a rule that for each file with path matches regular expression
    “/fooA/*.dat”, if the file has been created for more than 30 days,  then move the file to archive storage.
