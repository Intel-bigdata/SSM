<h3 class="text-center">Rules</h3>
<div class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-10">
  <p>
    A rule defines all the things for SSM to work: at what time, to analyze what kind of metrics and conditions,
    and what actions should be taken when the conditions are met.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By defining rules,
    a user can easily manage cluster and adjust its behavior for certain purposes. A rule contains 4 parts.
    The format is as follows.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Objects_to_manipulate :  Trigger | Conditions | Commands
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Trigger part is optional.  “:” and “|” are used to separate different
    rule parts. These two characters are reserved by SSM, and cannot be used in rule
    content, otherwise rule parse will fail.
    <br/>
